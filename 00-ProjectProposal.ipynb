It contains 16,598 game titles covering the period from 1995–2016, and is available to download in csv format for free with zero extra steps. Some key features that we can utilize are “year”, “genre” and regional sales data like “NA_sales”, “JP_sales”, “EU_sales”. Preprocessing may be needed as some data is missing like 278 values from “year”.\n",

The data was taken directly from SteamSpy and Steam Store APIs, being free to download with no extra permissions  in csv format (unless we were to take directly from the API, this would require an API key). Some important variables are genre, release data, price, and owners(estimated range of units sold).
