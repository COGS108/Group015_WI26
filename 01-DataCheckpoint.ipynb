    "The video game industry is a global market in which a variety of games are produced, distributed, and consumed across many different cultural and economic contexts. Questions have emerged about whether consumer preferences are shared worldwide or whether they remain shaped by regional markets. In particular, it is unclear whether players in different regions increasingly converge on similar genres and platforms as the market globalizes, or whether long‑standing regional tastes, platform ecosystems, and local industry structures continue to generate distinct patterns of demand. This tension between global convergence and regional differentiation motivates a closer empirical examination of how video game purchases vary across regions and how those patterns evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work in the video game industry has highlighted substantial variation in commercial performance across titles, even within the same release year. Building on this observation, researchers have identified product characteristics, most notably platform and genre as central determinants of sales outcomes. Studies using global sales rankings show that both platform and genre exert significant influence on overall units sold, suggesting that hardware ecosystems and content categories shape how games compete in the marketplace (Wang 2025). In addition to these product‑level attributes, regional sales variables have been shown to explain further variation in performance, indicating that demand conditions differ meaningfully across geographic markets. These findings motivate a more region sensitive approach to studying video game sales, in which regional market characteristics are treated as integral components of explanatory models rather than as residual or secondary factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, regional variation in video game consumption is not only cross‑sectional, but also temporally persistent. Studies of long run sales patterns have found that, while some genres attain widespread popularity, regional markets still tend to maintain distinct preferences that reflect cultural tastes and local industry structures (Zhang, 2021). This suggests that differences in the composition of regional game libraries are the result of relatively stable underlying demand conditions, rather than short‑term trends or one‑off blockbuster releases. In other words, regions do not simply converge on the same set of titles. Instead, they continue to favor different mixes of genres and platforms over time, indicating that regional identity and market context play a lasting role in shaping what players choose to buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Predictive Analytics for Video Game Sales” by Rifaz primarily focuses on predictive modeling of sales outcomes rather than on comparative analysis of regional preferences. This prior work shows that global sales outcomes can be predicted with very high accuracy using regional sales data, indicating that regional markets exhibit stable and structured sales patterns that consistently explain global success. However, it treats regions mainly as inputs to prediction rather than as objects of comparison. In particular, it does not examine whether regions systematically differ in their genre preferences after accounting for total market size, nor does it analyze how those differences change over time. This project builds on that analytical foundation but reframes the problem toward comparative and longitudinal analysis, focusing on genre market share by region and year rather than on \"The impact of platform on global video game sales\" has identified gaming platforms as a key structural factor influencing global video game sales patterns. Babb, Terry, and Dana (2013) examined worldwide video game sales across major platforms between 2006 and 2011 and found significant differences in sales performance attributable to platform ecosystems rather than individual game attributes alone. Their study showed that Nintendo platforms—particularly the Wii and Nintendo DS—consistently outperformed competing consoles globally, while Microsoft and Sony platforms occupied lower sales tiers. These findings suggest that platform strategy, vertical integration, and regional platform adoption play a central role in shaping observed sales distributions. This work provides an important foundation for our analysis of regional sales differences, particularly in understanding why Japan’s sales distribution diverges from North America and Europe, where non-Nintendo platforms are more dominant.\n",

    "We believe that there is a strong correlation between the difference in game genres and platforms from which those games are being sold by region, and we believe that the gap in video game sales will remain unchanged in the future. This can be seen in the research article on factors that impact global video game sales written by Zilu Wang, regions in North America and the European Union make up the majority of global video game sales, while Japan and other regions make up a smaller percentage, despite having a positive trend in video game sales. There is also a major regional difference in terms of video game genres, as cited from Xiaohan Zhang's research article on player preference, where North American regions and the EU favor action-type genre games, while Japanese players enjoy more moderate games like role-playing. No changes in the gap between regions in terms of sales will occur in the future based on the predictive analysis created by Faryal Rifaz and edited by Muhammad Tufail, as genres like Platform, Shooting, and Role-playing are the top three genres being sold which favor North American and EU regions."

    "1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\""

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",

For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\""
